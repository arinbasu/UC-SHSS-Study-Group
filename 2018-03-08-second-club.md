## Synopsis:

Reid et al argue that nurses must develop therapeutic relationships with cancer patients (and cancer survivors) for improving their quality of life. They conducted a series of interviews with cancer survivors who were in the stage of remission (age group between 45-70, and they were in remission at various stages of different cancers: head and neck, breast, bowel, and prostrate cancers). They inteterviewed 14 participants at home and used a hermeneutic approach to analyse the transcripts of the interviews. They found two emergent themes:
‘connectedness’ and ‘disconnectedness’ that were linked with ‘living well’ and ‘suffering’.
