- Summary:

While the method of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) has given uus deep insights into patterns of social and economic responses into different kinds of interventions, it would nevertheless be unwise to treat it as an ultimate determinant of the effectiveness of policy interventions. Basu argues  that  RCTs can actually mislead us. To avoid that and to  go from RCTs to determining the efficacy of actual policy interventions in the future, we need to use our intuition. By its very nature this is subjective, but we can improve on this by using evolutionary analysis to develop a notion of reasoned intuition.
