# Why do we need a journal club?

Students and faculty members need to read and write research. We also need to work as a community. Yet unless we can find a structured, dedicated time when we can do this, we tend to get distracted and often isolated from each other. While we need to read a considerable amount of literature to stay on top of the current literature load, the pressure of time and other workload make that task difficult. On the other hand, if we can find a way so that a collective reading of the key literature that we need to work on, or read to understand key topics relevant to our researhc are available, then it makes our work of writing our own papers and understanding the literature we have to tackle on a day to day basis easier.

Journal clubs provide that opportunity. A journal club is an activity where students & colleagues come together, read and discuss a publication (either a post publication paper that has already gone through peer review, or a prepublication such as the one we are discussing). 

# Setting up a Journal Club

The goal of this project is to set up a journal club at the University of Canterbury's School of Health Sciences. Here are the principles for joining and contributing to the journal club. Anyone can join the journal club. 

## The timing and venue of the journal club

1. We will organise the journal club weekly on Tuesday mornings (~ 9 AM) and we will run for an hour (9 - 10 AM).
2. We will identify one "pre-publication article" (more on this below) a week in advance and we will distribute an electronic copy of this article to all members of the journal club. We will also keep a copy of the article on this repository so you can download the article before coming to the journal club.
3. We will meet face to face at a designated room at the School of Health Sciences (I will announce the venue in the e-mail I sill send out)
4. Anyone is welcome to attend the journal club. However, if you want to attend the journal club, please let me know in advance and email me at: ![arindam.basu@canterbury.ac.nz](mailto:arindam.basu@canterbury.ac.nz) so that we will know.

## What will we do at the journal club

1. Before you join the journal club, you will need to have an account (free) at [http://www.authorea.com](http://www.authorea.com) and then let me know the email address. I will invite you to the journal club website.
2. Or you can also yourself to the preprint journal club by first signing up to Authorea (see point 1) and then to the preprint Journal club at the following address: [Preprint JC](https://prereview.org/inst/14743).
3. Following our discussion at the journal club, whoever will initiate the preprint discussion will then need to write a review of the preprint within three days of the completion of the journal club. 
4. Ideally, you will also need to have a github account and set up git on your computer. To set up a free github account, please visit [http://github.com](http://www.github.com) and set up your username and password. Then "fork" this repository to your own account. 
4. The guidelines for the writing the review of the preprint are given below

## Why do we select preprints?

- Preprints are not finished but nearly ready version of an academic output.
- By using preprints, we can include not only existing articles that are present in preprint archives that we can discuss, but we can also include your own works that you will consider submission to journals, conferences, doctoral disssertation chapters and pieces. This therefore sets up a continuity in our discussions where we can not only discuss existing preprints but also our own works that we can critique and have critiqued.

## Where will you get the preprints? 
Try the following preprint sources:

- PeerJ
- F1000
- socRxiv
- bioRxiv
- [Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org)
- prepubmed

## We will keep copies of preprints here

To get you started, I have put together a few articles here that we can discuss in the upcoming weeks. I can start the discussion with the first article. 

## Guidelines of how to write a review of the preprint article
Follow the questions and instructions in the following article to both conduct the review as well as writing the post-meeting review of the article:
